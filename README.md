# Vash-Config
This is my config. It is primearly a FPS boosting config for lowed PC/laptops, but it dose have some fun stuff like to.
Before you add the config to your autoexec file, if you don't have one rename the file to that, 
have a pock around and ajust some of the setings to fit your rig and personal perefrence.
